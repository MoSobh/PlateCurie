PlateFlex is a software for estimating the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere
from the inversion of flexural isostatic response functions calculated from a wavelet
analysis of gravity and topography data.

Installation
------------

Dependencies
++++++++++++

The current version was developed using **Python3.7** \
Also, the following package is required:

- `plateflex <https://github.com/paudetseis/PlateFlex>`_

See below for full installation details.

Conda environment
+++++++++++++++++

We recommend creating a custom ``conda`` environment
where ``platecurie`` can be installed along with its dependencies.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda create -n curie python=3.7 fortran-compiler numpy pymc3 matplotlib seaborn -c conda-forge

Activate the newly created environment:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda activate curie

Install the required ``plateflex`` software
(see `here <https://paudetseis.github.io/PlateFlex/getting_started.html#installing-from-source>`_)

Installing from source
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Clone the repository:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/paudetseis/PlateCurie.git
   cd PlateCurie

- Install using ``pip``

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip install .
